Arduino and the GSR sensor setup

1. Lock the E-shield into the Arduino, matching the pins (i.e. GND to GND).
2. To get a proper signal, use a moistened piece of paper tissue and place it on the metal sensor before strapping the velcro to the fingers.
3. The code that you need to upload on the arduino is in this repository : GSR_script.ino

Also you need to install the eHealth library from the Cooking Hacks website https://www.cooking-hacks.com/documentation/tutorials/ehealth-biometric-sensor-platform-arduino-raspberry-pi-medical



In order to use the code for the shapes software you will need:
- Linux based computer- Ubuntu 14.04+
- Qt framework version 5.4+
- Qt creator http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/ 
- GCC compiler version 4.9.2(it needs C++11 support)

Open the project in QT creator, build and run.
