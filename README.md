Arduino and the GSR sensor setup

1. Lock the E-shield into the Arduino, matching the pins (i.e. GND to GND).
2. To get a proper signal, use a moistened piece of paper tissue and place it on the metal sensor before strapping the velcro to the fingers.
3. The code that you need to upload on the arduino is in this repository : GSR_script.ino

Also you need to install the eHealth.h library from the Cooking Hacks website.

- Linux based computer- Ubuntu 15..04
